real-time dashboard that captures and visualizes streaming data, enhancing the accessibility and usability of critical information for professionals, investment communities, and enthusiasts. Our
primary focus is on constructing a scalable and efficient data pipeline designed to seamlessly handle the ingestion, processing, analysis, and visualization of substantial volumes of real-time
streaming data. The methodology involves harnessing big data technologies to deliver real-time insights, empowering businesses to make prompt and informed data-driven decisions. This entails
the development of a robust data ingestion system, the implementation of streaming analytics algorithms, and the creation of interactive dashboards tailored for visualization purposes
